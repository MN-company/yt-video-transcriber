## Objective
The objective is to transcribe a video independently in as little time and steps as possible. With this tool, simply by starting from the link you can obtain a .TXT file containing the entire transcription even if the video does not natively allow it.

# Local execution
If you have a powerful enough machine, you can run the Whisper template locally to transcribe the downloaded video. However, this method requires disk space and power that not everyone has.
- Download the repo locally and simply run the requirments.txt
- And then run the "main.py"
- Paste the Youtube link and you will find the transcript in the download folder

# Cloud execution
For those who do not have a powerful machine, my advice is to run the code through Google Colab.
- Open the Colab file and follow the instructions inside

- Simply go to this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HnjENO6ZjD2l5M782YvucylIdYT8UV2i?usp=sharing) and create a copy (or use the proposed code directly)
